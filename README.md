# Portfolio: Major first term project as part of the Coder Factory Academy fast track bootcamp program.

This is the Term 1 major project as part of the Coder Factory Academy bootcamp due after the 4th week of term. The storyboard can be found here: https://trello.com/b/28551eGW/portfolio-project 

  - Create a website
  - Website is to serve as a portfolio of my web development skills and accomplishments
    showing other projects completed thus far.
  - Designed as a way for potential employers to assess my suitability for any available        employment opportunities within their organisation.

# Features:

  - About section detailing who I am and what I looking for employment wise.
  - Skills section detailing the programming languages, frameworks and supporting software tools I will be proficient with at the conclusion of the program
  - Countdown timer showing employers exactly when I will be completing the course and ready to start paid work.


# Installation:
  - The website was created within Rails
  - HTML and SCSS were the files used with a dash of Javascript for the countdown timer
  - The website runs easily within the rails server on localhost:3000
  - Some files are absent from the Github due to Github file size restrictions

# Usage:
The navigation buttons are always on top so clearly outline the available sections and all buttons are active and working.

# Development

First was pen and paer wireframing to sketch out, roughly, what the site would look like and what would go where content wise.
